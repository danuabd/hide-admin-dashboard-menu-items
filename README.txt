Hide unwanted dashboard and toolbar menu items in WordPress and prevent unauthorized access to their pages.

== Description ==

**Hide Dashboard Menu Items** is a simple yet powerful plugin that gives administrators full control over the visibility of dashboard and toolbar menus in the WordPress admin area.

Easily clean up your backend interface by hiding items that aren't needed — whether they’re from core, plugins, themes, or custom post types. You can also block access to those hidden pages to prevent users from accessing them directly via URL.

This plugin is ideal for developers, agencies, and anyone managing multi-user WordPress websites.

### Key Features

* Hide selected items from the menu and toolbar.

* Bypass restrictions with a secret query string or password.
* Reset all settings at any time.
* Lightweight and easy to use.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `hide-dashboard-menu-items` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
